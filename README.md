## 🌟 Why Invio?

- Built for doing, not configuring — create an invoice, send a link, get paid. No CRMs, projects, or bloat getting in your way.
- You really own it — self‑hosted by default. Your data lives where you put it, and exporting is always an option.
- Fast & dependable — Deno + Fresh on the frontend and Hono + SQLite on the backend keep things simple and quick.
- Client‑friendly — share a secure public link—no accounts or passwords required to view invoices.
